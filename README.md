# Aim of the Package
"VariableSelection‚Äù package enables users to identify the set of predictors of a binary outcome. The package is a simple tool to help researchers put aside any doubts they have regarding the complexity of modern methods or statistical software programming; using a single command, the researcher can implement various approaches of variable selection on his/er own dataset. Such methods include filters and wrappers containing more than 20 specific approaches. Numerical and graphical outputs are easily obtained as well.
