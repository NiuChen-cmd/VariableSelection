Description: This package enables users to identify the appropriate set of predictors of a
    binary outcome of interest for diagnostic/ptognostic situations. Various approaches for
    selecting variables have been implemented, including Filter and
    Wrapper approaches. Numerical and graphical output can be easily obtained.
    The package attempts to provide user-friendly outputs for those who are interested only in the results.
